# Numbers_in_the_draw
 You have two numbers on input(first >= second). As a result you have their sum, sub, mul and div in decimnal, bin and hex systems. All this in a draw. My advice is to input next coordintaes of the draw: x = 4; y = 4; length = 70; width = 16. As an example, try num_1 = 10, num_2 = 2.
